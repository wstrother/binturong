# Binturong

This is going to be the blogging tool I use to manage both my tech/dev oriented blog and my music/social-media oriented blog. The idea will be to generate 
a static site that can be deployed on GH pages with a build command that can switch between different themes and different lists of markdown files for blog posts.

I'm also going to build a dev mode whereby I can edit Markdown and preview in real time, plus have a simpel drag-and-drop tool for uploading image files.
